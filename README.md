# 🐦 Bird Species Recognition with Raspberry Pi

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a bird species dataset to recognize birds in real time using a Raspberry Pi and a connected camera module.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Train a custom CNN model on a bird species dataset.
- Deploy the model on a Raspberry Pi with a connected camera.
- Automatically detect and classify birds in live camera feed.
- Store the species name timestamp and image of the specimen.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🖥️ On your development PC:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-recognition-pi.git
   cd bird-recognition-pi
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install requirements:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Train the model (or skip if already trained):
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

4. Export the trained model:
   ```bash
   torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
   ```

---

### 🍓 On Raspberry Pi:

1. Set up the Pi with Raspbian OS and connect the camera.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run live recognition:
   ```bash
   python recognize.py
   ```

4. The system will display live camera footage with bird species prediction overlayed.
